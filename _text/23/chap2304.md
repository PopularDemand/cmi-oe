<sup>41</sup> Is it not true you do not recognize some of the forms attack can
take? If it is true attack in any form will hurt you and will do so just
as much as in another form which you *do* recognize, then it must follow
that you do not always recognize the source of pain. Attack in *any*
form is equally destructive. Its purpose does not change. Its sole
intent is murder, and what form of murder serves to cover the massive
guilt and frantic fear of punishment the murderer must feel? He may deny
he is a murderer and justify his savagery with smiles as he attacks. Yet
he will suffer and will look on his intent in nightmares where the
smiles are gone and where the purpose rises to meet his horrified
awareness and pursue him still. For no one thinks of murder and escapes
the guilt the *thought* entails. If the intent is death, what matter the
form it takes?

<sup>42</sup> Is death in any form, however lovely and charitable it may seem to
be, a blessing and a sign the Voice for God speaks through you to your
brother? The wrapping does not make the gift you give. An empty box,
however beautiful and gently given, still contains nothing. And neither
the receiver nor the giver is long deceived. Withhold forgiveness from
your brother, and you attack him. You give him nothing and receive of
him but what you gave.

<sup>43</sup> Salvation is no compromise of any kind. To compromise is to accept
but part of what you want—to take a little and give up the rest.
Salvation gives up nothing. It is complete for everyone. Let the idea of
compromise but enter, and the awareness of salvation's purpose is lost
because it is not recognized. It is denied where compromise has been
accepted, for compromise is the belief salvation is impossible. It would
maintain you can attack a little, love a little, and know the
*difference.* Thus it would teach a little of the same can still be
different, and yet the same remain intact as one. Does this make sense?
Can it *be* understood?

<sup>44</sup> This course is easy just because it makes no compromise. Yet it seems
difficult to those who still believe that compromise is possible. They
do not see that, if it is, salvation is *attack*. Yet it is certain the
belief that salvation is impossible cannot uphold a quiet, calm
assurance it has come. Forgiveness cannot be withheld a little. Nor is
it possible to attack for this and love for that and understand
forgiveness. Would you not *want* to recognize assault upon your peace
in any form, if only thus does it become impossible that *you* lose
sight of it? It can be kept shining before your vision, forever clear
and never out of sight if you defend it not.

<sup>45</sup> Those who believe that peace can *be* defended and that attack is
justified on its behalf cannot perceive it lies within them. How could
they know? Could they accept forgiveness side by side with the belief
that murder takes some forms by which their peace is saved? Would they
be willing to accept the fact their savage purpose is directed against
themselves? No one unites with enemies nor is at one with them in
purpose. And no one compromises with an enemy but hates him still for
what he kept from him.

<sup>46</sup> Mistake not truce for peace, nor compromise for the escape from
conflict. To be released from conflict means that it is *over*. The door
is open; you have *left* the battleground. You have not lingered there
in cowering hope because the guns are stilled an instant and the fear
that haunts the place of death is not apparent, that it will not return.
There *is* no safety in a battleground. You can look down on it in
safety from above and not be touched. But from within it, you can find
*no* safety. Not one tree left standing still will shelter you. Not one
illusion of protection stands against the faith in murder. Here stands
the body, torn between the natural desire to communicate and the
unnatural intent to murder and to die. Think you the *form* that murder
takes can offer safety? Can guilt be *absent* from a battlefield? \[Do
not remain in conflict, for there *is* no war without attack.\]
