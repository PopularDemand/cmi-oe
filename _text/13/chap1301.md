All therapy is release from the past. That is why the Holy Spirit is the
only therapist. He teaches that the past does not exist, a fact which
belongs to the sphere of knowledge and which therefore no one in the
world knows. It would indeed be impossible to *be* in the world with
this knowledge. For the mind that knows this unequivocally knows also
that it dwells in eternity and utilizes no perception at all. It
therefore does not consider where it is because the concept “where” does
not mean anything to it. It knows that it is *everywhere*, just as it
*has everything*, and *forever*.

<sup>2</sup> The very real difference between perception and knowledge becomes
quite apparent if you consider this: There is nothing partial about
knowledge. Every aspect is whole, and therefore no aspect is separate.
*You* are an aspect of knowledge, being in the Mind of God, Who *knows*
you. All knowledge must be yours, for in you *is* all knowledge.
Perception at its loftiest is never complete. Even the perception of the
Holy Spirit, as perfect as perception can be, is without meaning in
Heaven. Perception can reach everywhere under His guidance, for the
vision of Christ beholds everything in light. Yet no perception, however
holy, will last forever.
