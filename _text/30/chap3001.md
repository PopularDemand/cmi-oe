The new beginning now becomes the focus of the curriculum. The goal is
clear, but now you need specific methods for attaining it. The speed by
which it can be reached depends on this one thing alone—your willingness
to practice every step. Each one will help a little every time it is
attempted. And together will these steps lead you from dreams of
judgment to forgiving dreams and out of pain and fear. They are not new
to you, but they are more ideas than rules of thought to you as yet. So
now we need to practice them awhile, until they are the rules by which
you live. We seek to make them habits now, so you will have them ready
for whatever need.
