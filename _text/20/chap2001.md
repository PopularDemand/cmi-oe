This is Palm Sunday, the celebration of victory and the acceptance of
the truth. Let us not spend this holy week brooding on the crucifixion
of God's Son, but happily in the celebration of his release. For Easter
is the sign of peace, not pain. A slain Christ has no meaning. But a
*risen* Christ becomes the symbol of the Son of God's forgiveness of
himself; the sign he looks upon himself as healed and whole.
