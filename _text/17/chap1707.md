<sup>57</sup> The practical application of the Holy Spirit's purpose is extremely
simple, but it *is* unequivocal. In fact in order to be simple, it
*must* be unequivocal. The simple is merely what is easily understood,
and for this it is apparent that it must be clear. The setting of the
Holy Spirit's goal is general. Now He will work with you to make it
specific \[for application *is* specific\]. There are certain very
specific guidelines He provides for any situation, but remember that you
do not yet realize their universal application. Therefore it is
essential at this point to use them in each situation separately, until
you can more safely look *beyond* each situation in an understanding far
broader than you now possess.

<sup>58</sup> In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to
consider, very simply, is, “What do I want to come of this? What is it
*for*?” The clarification of the goal belongs at the *beginning*, for it
is this which will determine the outcome. In the ego's procedure, this
is reversed. The *situation* becomes the determiner of the outcome,
which can be anything. The reason for this disorganized approach is
evident. The ego does not know what it *wants* to come of it. It is
aware of what it does *not* want, but only that. It has no positive goal
at all.

<sup>59</sup> Without a clear cut positive goal, set at the outset, the situation
just seems to happen and makes no sense until it has *already* happened.
*Then* you look back at it and try to piece together what it must have
meant. And you will be *wrong*. Not only is your judgment in the past,
but you have no idea what *should* happen. No goal was set with which to
bring the means in line. And now the only judgment left to make is
whether or not the ego likes it—is it acceptable, or does it call for
vengeance? The absence of a criterion for outcome set *in advance* makes
understanding doubtful and evaluation impossible.

<sup>60</sup> The value of deciding in advance what you *want* to happen is simply
that you will perceive the situation as a means to *make* it happen. You
will therefore make every effort to overlook what interferes with the
accomplishment of your objective and concentrate on everything which
helps you meet it. It is quite noticeable that this approach has brought
you closer to the Holy Spirit's sorting out of truth and falsity. The
true becomes what can be used to meet the goal. The false becomes the
useless from this point of view. The situation now has meaning, but only
because the *goal* has made it meaningful.

<sup>61</sup> The goal of truth has further practical advantages. If the situation
is used for truth and sanity, its outcome *must* be peace. And this is
quite *apart* from what the outcome *is*. If peace is the condition of
truth and sanity and cannot be *without* them, where peace is *they*
must be. Truth comes of itself. If you experience peace, it is because
the truth has come to you, and you will see the outcome truly, for
deception cannot prevail against you. And you will recognize the outcome
*because* you are at peace. Here again, you see the opposite of the
ego's way of looking, for the ego believes the *situation* brings the
experience. The Holy Spirit knows that the situation is as the goal
determines it and is experienced *according* to the goal.

<sup>62</sup> The goal of truth requires faith. Faith is implicit in the acceptance
of the Holy Spirit's purpose, and this faith is all-inclusive. Where the
goal of truth is set, there faith *must* be. The Holy Spirit sees the
situation as a *whole*. The goal establishes the fact that everyone
involved in it will play his part in its accomplishment. This is
inevitable. No one will fail in anything. This seems to ask for faith
beyond you and beyond what you can give. Yet this is so only from the
viewpoint of the ego, for the ego believes in “solving” conflict through
fragmentation and does *not* perceive the situation as a whole.
Therefore, it seeks to split off segments of the situation and deal with
them *separately*, for it has faith in separation and not in wholeness.

<sup>63</sup> Confronted with any aspect of the situation which seems to be
difficult, the ego will attempt to take this aspect elsewhere and
resolve it there. And it will seem to be successful, except that this
attempt conflicts with unity and *must* obscure the goal of truth. And
peace will not be experienced except in fantasy. Truth has not come
because faith has been denied, being withheld from where it rightfully
belonged. Thus do you lose the understanding of the situation the goal
of truth would bring. For fantasy solutions bring but the illusion of
experience, and the illusion of peace is not the condition in which the
truth can enter.

<sup>64</sup> The substitutes for aspects of the situation are the witnesses to
your lack of faith. They demonstrate that you did not believe that the
situation and the *problem* were in the same place. The problem *was*
the lack of faith, and it is this you demonstrate when you remove it
from its source and place it elsewhere. As a result, you do not see the
*problem*. Had you not lacked the faith it could be solved, the problem
would be gone. And the situation would have been meaningful to you
because the interference in the way of understanding would have been
removed. To remove the problem elsewhere is to *keep* it. For you remove
yourself *from* it and make it unsolvable.
