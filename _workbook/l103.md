Happiness is an attribute of love. It cannot be apart from it, nor can
it be experienced where love is not. Love has no limits, being
everywhere. And therefore joy is everywhere as well. Yet can the mind
deny that this is so, believing there are gaps in love where sin can
enter, bringing pain instead of joy.

This strange belief would limit happiness by redefining love as limited,
and introducing opposition in what has no limit and no opposite. Fear is
associated then with love, and its results become the heritage of minds
that think what they have made is real. These images, with no reality in
truth, bear witness to the fear of God, forgetting being Love He must be
joy.

This basic error we will try again to bring to truth today, and teach
ourselves:

> “God, being Love, is also happiness.
> To fear Him is to be afraid of joy.”

Begin your longer exercises for today with this association, which
corrects the false belief that God is fear. It also emphasizes happiness
belongs to you because of what He is.

Allow this one correction to be placed within your minds each waking
hour today. Then welcome all the happiness it brings, as truth replaces
fear, and joy becomes what you expect to take the place of pain. God
being Love, it will be given you. Bolster this expectation frequently
throughout the day, and quiet all your fears with this assurance, kind
and wholly true:

> “God, being Love, is also happiness.<br/>
> And it is happiness I seek today.<br/>
> I cannot fail, because I seek the truth.”
