Today we will begin to insert some of the happy things to which you are
entitled, being what you are. No long practice periods are required
today, but very frequent short ones are necessary. Once every ten
minutes would be highly desirable, and you are urged to attempt this and
to adhere to this schedule whenever possible. If you forget, try again.
If there are long interruptions, try again. Whenever you remember, try
again.

You need not close your eyes for the exercise periods, although you will
probably find it more helpful if you do. However, you may be in a number
of situations during the day when closing your eyes would not be
appropriate. Do not miss a practice period because of this. You can
practice quite well under almost any circumstance, if you really want
to.

Today’s exercises take little time and no effort. Repeat today’s idea,
and then add several of the attributes which you associate with being a
Son of God, applying them to yourself. One practice period might, for
example, consist of the following:

> “I am blessed as a Son of God.

> I am happy, peaceful, loving and contented.”

Another might be something as follows:

> “I am blessed as a Son of God.

> I am calm, quiet, assured and confident.”

If only a brief period is available, merely telling yourself that you
are blessed as a Son of God will do.
