These are the ideas for today’s review:

[*67*](/workbook/l067/?r=1) **“Love created me like Itself.”**
{: #l067}

I am in the likeness of my Creator. I cannot suffer, I cannot experience
loss, and I cannot die. I am not a body. I would recognize my reality
today. I will worship no idols, nor raise my own self-concepts to
replace my Self. I am in the likeness of my Creator. Love created me
like Itself.

You might find these specific forms helpful in applying the idea:

> “Let me not see an illusion of myself in this.”<br/>
> “As I look on this, let me remember my Creator.”<br/>
> “My Creator did not create this as I see it.”

[*68*](/workbook/l068/?r=1) **“Love holds no grievances.”**
{: #l068}

Grievances are completely alien to love. Grievances attack love, and
keep its light obscure. If I hold grievances I am attacking love, and
therefore attacking my Self. My Self thus becomes alien to me. I am
determined not to attack my Self today, so that I can remember who I am.

These specific forms for applying this idea would be helpful:

> “This is no justification for denying my Self.”<br/>
> “I will not use this to attack love.”<br/>
> “Let this not tempt me to attack myself.”
