My holy vision sees all things as pure.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> *Father, Your Mind created all that is; Your Spirit entered
into it; Your Love gave life to it. And would I look upon what You
created as if it could be made sinful? I would not perceive such dark
and fearful images. A madman's dream is hardly fit to be my choice
instead of all the loveliness with which You blessed creation—all its
purity, its joy, and its eternal, quiet home in You.*

<sup>2</sup> And while we still remain outside the gate of Heaven, let
us look on all we see through holy vision and the eyes of Christ. Let
all appearances seem pure to us that we may pass them by in innocence
and walk together to our Father's house as brothers and the holy Sons of
God.
