title: Review Lessons 79 - 80
ref: "90"

<sup>1</sup> For this review we will use these ideas:

\[79\] Let me recognize the problem so it can be solved.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>2</sup> Let me realize today that the problem is always some form
of grievance which I would cherish. Let me also understand that the
solution is always a miracle with which I let the grievance be replaced.
Today I would remember the simplicity of salvation by reinforcing the
lesson that there is one problem and one solution. The problem is a
grievance; the solution is a miracle. And I invite the solution to come
to me through my forgiveness of the grievance and my welcome of the
miracle which takes its place.

<sup>3</sup> Specific applications of this idea might be in these forms:

<sup>4</sup> *This presents a problem to me which I would have
resolved.<br/> The miracle behind this grievance will resolve it for
me.<br/> The answer to this problem is the miracle which it conceals*.

\[80\] Let me recognize my problems have been solved.

<sup>5</sup> I seem to have problems only because I am misusing time. I
believe that the problem comes first, and time must elapse before it can
be worked out. I do not see the problem and the answer as simultaneous
in their occurrence. That is because I do not yet realize that God has
placed the answer together with the problem, so that they cannot be
separated by time. The Holy Spirit will teach me this if I will let Him.
And I will understand it is impossible that I could have a problem which
has not been solved already.

<sup>6</sup> These forms of the idea will be useful for specific
applications:

<sup>7</sup> *I need not wait for this to be resolved.<br/> The answer
to this problem is already given me if I will accept it.<br/> Time
cannot separate this problem from its solution*.
