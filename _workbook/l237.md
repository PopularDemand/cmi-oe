Now would I be as God created me.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Today I will accept the truth about myself. I will arise in
glory and allow the light in me to shine upon the world throughout the
day. I bring the world the tidings of salvation that I hear as God my
Father speaks to me. And I behold the world that Christ would have me
see, aware it ends the bitter dream of death, aware it is my Father's
call to me.

<sup>2</sup> *Christ is my eyes today, and His the ears which listen to
the Voice of God today. Father, I come to You through Him Who is Your
Son and my true Self as well. Amen*.
