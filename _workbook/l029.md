The idea for today explains why you can see all purpose in anything. It
explains why nothing is separate, by itself or in itself. And it
explains why nothing you see means anything. In fact, it explains every
idea we have used thus far, and all subsequent ones as well. Today’s
idea is the whole basis for vision.

You will probably find this idea very difficult to grasp at this point.
You may find it silly, irreverent, senseless, funny and even
objectionable. Certainly God is not in a table, for example, as you see
it.Yet we emphasized yesterday that a table shares the purpose of the
universe. And what shares the purpose of the universe shares the purpose
of its Creator.

Try then, today, to begin to learn how to look on all things with love,
appreciation and open-mindedness. You do not see them now. Would you
know what is in them? Nothing is as it appears to you. Its holy purpose
stands beyond your little range.When vision has shown you the holiness
that lights up the world, you will understand today’s idea perfectly.
And you will not understand how you could ever have found it difficult.

Our six two minute practice periods for today should follow a now
familiar pattern: Begin with repeating the idea to yourself, and then
apply it to randomly chosen subjects about you, naming each one
specifically. Try to avoid the tendency toward self-directed selection,
which may be particularly tempting in connection with today’s idea
because of its wholly alien nature. Remember that any order you impose
is equally alien to reality.

Your list of subjects should therefore be as free of self-selection as
possible. For example, a suitable list might include:

> *“God is in this coat hanger.”*

> *“God is in this magazine.”*

> *“God is in this finger.”*

> *“God is in this lamp.”*

> *“God is in that body.”*

> *“God is in that door.”*

> *“God is in that wastebasket.”*

In addition to the assigned practice periods, repeat the idea for today
at least once an hour, looking slowly about you as you say the words
unhurriedly to yourself. At least once or twice you should experience a
sense of restfulness as you do this.
