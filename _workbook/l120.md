For morning and evening review:

[*109*](/workbook/l109/?r=1) **“I rest in God.”**
{: #l109}

> I rest in God today, and let Him work<br/>
> In me and through me, while I rest in Him<br/>
> In quiet and in perfect certainty.

[*110*](/workbook/l110/?r=1) **“I am as God created me.”**
{: #l110}

> I am God’s Son.Today I lay aside<br/>
> All sick illusions of myself, and let<br/>
> My Father tell me Who I really am.

On the hour:

> “I rest in God.”

On the half hour:

> “I am as God created me.”
