For morning and evening review:

[*105*](/workbook/l105/?r=1) **“God’s peace and joy are mine.”**
{: #l105}

> Today I will accept God’s peace and joy<br/>
> In glad exchange for all the substitutes<br/>
> Which I have made for happiness and peace.

[*106*](/workbook/l106/?r=1) **“Let me be still and listen to the truth.”**
{: #l106}

> Let mine own feeble voice be still, and let<br/>
> Me hear the mighty Voice of truth itself<br/>
> Assure me that I am God’s perfect Son.

On the hour:

> “God’s peace and joy are mine.”

On the half hour:

> “Let me be still and listen to the truth.”
