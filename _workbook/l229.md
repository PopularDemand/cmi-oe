I seek my own identity, and find It in these words: “Love, Which created
me, is what I am.” Now need I seek no more. Love has prevailed. So still
it waited for my coming home, that I will turn away no longer from the
holy face of Christ. And what I look upon attests the truth of the
identity I sought to lose, but which my Father has kept safe for me.

*“Father, my thanks to You for what I am; for keeping my identity
untouched and sinless in the midst of all the thoughts of sin my foolish
mind made up. And thanks to You for saving me from them. Amen.”*
