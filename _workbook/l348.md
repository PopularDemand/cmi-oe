*“Father, let me remember You are here, and I am not alone. Surrounding
me is everlasting Love. I have no cause for anything except the perfect
peace and joy I share with You. What need have I for anger or for fear?
Surrounding me is perfect safety. Can I be afraid, when Your Eternal
promise goes with me? Surrounding me is perfect sinlessness. What can I
fear, when You created me in holiness as perfect as Your own?”*

God’s grace suffices us in everything that He would have us do. And only
that we choose to be our will as well as His.
