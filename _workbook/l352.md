*“Forgiveness looks on sinlessness alone, and judges not. Through this I
come to You. Judgement will bind my eyes and make me blind. Yet love,
reflected in forgiveness here, reminds me You have given me a way to
find Your peace again. I am redeemed when I elect to follow in this
way. You have not left me comfortless. I have within me both the memory
of You, and One Who leads me to it. Father, I would hear Your Voice, and
find Your peace today. For I would love my own Identity, and find in Him
the memory of You.”*
