<p><sup>1</sup> Vision depends upon todayâ€™s idea. The light is in it, for
it reconciles all seeming opposites. And what is light except the
resolution, born of peace, of all your conflicts and mistaken thoughts
into one concept which is wholly true? Even that one will disappear
because the Thought behind it will appear instead, to take its place.
And now we are at peace forever, for the dream is over now.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> True light which makes true vision possible is not the
light the bodyâ€™s eyes behold. It is a state of mind which has become so
unified that darkness cannot be perceived at all. And thus what is the
same is seen as one, while what is not the same remains unnoticed, for
it is not there.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> This is the light which shows no opposites, and vision,
being healed, has power to heal. This is the light that brings your
peace of mind to other minds, to share it and be glad that they are one
with you and with themselves. This is the light which heals because it
brings single perception, based upon one frame of reference from which
one meaning comes.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Here are both giving and receiving seen as different
aspects of one Thought Whose truth does not depend on which is seen as
first, nor which appears to be in second place. Here it is understood
that both occur together, that the thought remain complete. And in this
understanding is the base on which all opposites are reconciled because
they are perceived from the same frame of reference which unifies this
thought.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> One Thought, completely unified, will serve to unify all
thought. This is the same as saying one correction will suffice for all
correction or that to forgive one brother wholly is enough to bring
salvation to all minds. For these are but some special cases of one law
which holds for every kind of learning if it be directed by the One Who
knows the truth.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> To learn that giving and receiving are the same has special
usefulness because it can be tried so easily and seen as true. And when
this special case has proved it always works in every circumstance where
it is tried, the thought behind it can be generalized to other areas of
doubt and double vision. And from there it will extend and finally
arrive at the one thought Which underlies them all.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Today we practice with the special case of giving and
receiving. We will use this simple lesson in the obvious because it has
results we cannot miss. To give is to receive. Today we will attempt to
offer peace to everyone and see how quickly peace returns to us. Light
is tranquility, and in that peace is vision given us and we can see.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> So we begin the practice periods with the instruction for
today and say:</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> <em>To give and to receive are one in truth.<br />
I will receive what I am giving now.</em></p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Then close your eyes, and for five minutes think of what
you would hold out to everyone to have it yours. You might, for
instance, say:</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> <em>To everyone I offer quietness.<br />
To everyone I offer peace of mind.<br />
To everyone I offer gentleness.</em></p>

<p><sup>12</sup> Say each one slowly, and then pause a while, expecting to
receive the gift you gave, and it will come to you in the amount in
which you gave it. You will find you have exact return, for this is what
you asked. It might be helpful, too, to think of one to whom to give
your gifts. He represents the others, and through him you give to all.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Our very simple lesson for today will teach you much.
Effect and cause will be far better understood from this time on, and we
will make much faster progress now. Think of the exercises for today as
quick advances in your learning, made still faster and more sure each
time you say:</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> <em>To give and to receive are one in truth.</em></p>
