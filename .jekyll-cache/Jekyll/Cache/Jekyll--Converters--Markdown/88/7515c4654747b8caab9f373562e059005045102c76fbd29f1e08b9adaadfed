I"õ<p><sup>1</sup> Today we will review these ideas:</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[75] The light has come.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In choosing salvation rather than attack, I merely choose
to recognize what is already here. Salvation is a decision made already.
Attack and grievances are not there to choose. That is why I always
choose between truth and illusion, between what is there and what is
not. The light has come. I can but choose the light, for it has no
alternative. It has replaced the darkness, and the dark is gone.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> These would prove useful forms for specific applications of
this idea:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>This cannot show me darkness, for the light has come.<br />
The light in you is all that I would see, [name].<br /> I would see in
this only what is there</em>.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[76] I am under no laws but Godâ€™s.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Here is the perfect statement of my freedom. I am under no
laws but Godâ€™s. I am constantly tempted to make up other laws and give
them power over me. I suffer only because of my belief in them. They
have no real effect on me at all. I am perfectly free of the effects of
all laws save Godâ€™s. And His are the laws of freedom.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> For specific forms in applying this idea, these would be
useful:</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <em>My perception of this shows me I believe in laws which do
not exist.<br /> I see only the laws of God at work in this.<br /> Let me
allow Godâ€™s laws to work in this and not my own</em>.</p>
