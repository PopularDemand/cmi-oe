I"‘<p class="lesson-header">A happy outcome to all things is sure.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Godâ€™s promises make no exceptions. And He guarantees that
only joy can be the final outcome found for everything. Yet it is up to
us when this is reachedâ€”how long we let an alien will appear to be
opposing His. And while we think this will is real, we will not find the
end He has appointed as the outcome of all problems we perceive, all
trials we see, and every situation that we meet. Yet is the ending
certain. For Godâ€™s Will is done in earth and Heaven. We will seek and we
will find according to His Will, which guarantees that our will is done.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>We thank You, Father, for Your guarantee of only happy
outcomes in the end. Help us not interfere and so delay the happy
endings You have promised us for every problem that we can perceive, for
every trial we think we still must meet.</em></p>
