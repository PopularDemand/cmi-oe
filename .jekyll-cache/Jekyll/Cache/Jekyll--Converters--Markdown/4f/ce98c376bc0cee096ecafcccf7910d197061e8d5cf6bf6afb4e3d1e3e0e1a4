<p>Correction of a lasting nature‚Äîand only this is true correction‚Äîcannot
be made until the teacher of God has ceased to confuse interpretation
with fact or illusion with truth. If he argues with his pupil about a
magic thought, attacks it, tries to establish its error or demonstrate
its falsity, he is but witnessing to its reality. Depression is then
inevitable, for he has ‚Äúproved,‚Äù both to his pupil and himself, that it
is their task to escape from what is real. And this can only be
impossible. Reality is changeless. Magic thoughts are but illusions.
Otherwise salvation would be only the same age-old impossible dream in
but another form. Yet the dream of salvation has new content. It is not
the form alone in which the difference lies.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> God‚Äôs teachers‚Äô major lesson is to learn how to react to
magic thoughts wholly without anger. Only in this way can they proclaim
the truth about themselves. Through them, the Holy Spirit can now speak
of the reality of the Son of God. Now He can remind the world of
sinlessness, the one unchanged, unchangeable condition of all that God
created. Now He can speak the Word of God to listening ears and bring
Christ‚Äôs vision to the eyes that see. Now is He free to teach all minds
the truth of what they are, so they will gladly be returned to Him. And
now is guilt forgiven, overlooked completely in His sight and in God‚Äôs
Word.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Anger but screeches, ‚ÄúGuilt is real.‚Äù Reality is blotted
out as this insane belief is taken as replacement for God‚Äôs Word. The
body‚Äôs eyes now ‚Äúsee‚Äù; its ears alone are thought to hear. Its little
space and tiny breath become the measure of reality. And truth becomes
diminutive and meaningless. Correction has one answer to all this and to
the world that rests on this:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>You but mistake interpretation for the truth. And you are
wrong. But a mistake is not a sin, nor has reality been taken from its
throne by your mistakes. God reigns forever, and His laws alone prevail
upon you and upon the world. His love remains the only thing there is.
Fear is illusion, for you are like Him</em>.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> In order to heal, it thus becomes essential for the teacher
of God to let all his own mistakes be corrected. If he senses even the
faintest hint of irritation in himself as he responds to anyone, let him
instantly realize that he has made an interpretation that is not true.
Then let him turn within to his Eternal Guide, and let Him judge what
the response should be. So is he healed, and in his healing is his pupil
healed with him. The sole responsibility of God‚Äôs teacher is to accept
the Atonement for himself. Atonement means correction, or the undoing of
errors. When this has been accomplished, the teacher of God becomes a
miracle worker by definition. His sins have been forgiven him, and he no
longer condemns himself. How can he then condemn anyone? And who is
there whom his forgiveness can fail to heal?</p>
