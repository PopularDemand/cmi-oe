I"$<p class="lesson-header">God is my life. I have no life but His.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I was mistaken when I thought I lived apart from God, a
separate entity which moved in isolation, unattached, and housed within
a body. Now I know my life is God’s. I have no other home, and I do not
exist apart from Him. He has no thoughts that are not part of me, and I
have none but those which are of Him.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Our Father, let us see the face of Christ instead of our
mistakes. For we who are Your holy Son are sinless. We would look upon
our sinlessness, for guilt proclaims that we are not Your Son. And we
would not forget You longer. We are lonely here and long for Heaven
where we are at home. Today we would return. Our Name is Yours, and we
acknowledge that we are Your Son.</em></p>
