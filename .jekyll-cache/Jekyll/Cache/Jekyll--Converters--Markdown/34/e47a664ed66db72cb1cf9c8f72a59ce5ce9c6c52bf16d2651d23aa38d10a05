I"`<p><sup>29</sup> The introduction of reason into the ego’s thought system is the
beginning of its undoing. For reason and the ego are contradictory. Nor
is it possible for them to co-exist in your awareness. And reason’s goal
is to make plain and therefore obvious. You can <em>see</em> reason. This is
not a play on words, for here is the beginning of a vision that has
meaning. Vision is sense, quite literally. If it is not the body’s
sight, it <em>must</em> be understood. For it is <em>plain</em>, and what is obvious
is not ambiguous. It <em>can</em> be understood. And here do reason and the ego
separate to go their different ways.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup> The ego’s whole continuance depends on its belief you cannot learn
this course. Share this belief, and reason will be unable to see your
errors and make way for their correction. For reason sees <em>through</em>
errors, telling you what you thought was real is not. Reason can see the
difference between sin and mistakes because it <em>wants</em> correction.
Therefore, it tells you what you thought was uncorrectable <em>can</em> be
corrected, and thus it must have been an error. The ego’s opposition to
correction leads to its fixed belief in sin and disregard of errors. It
looks on <em>nothing</em> that can be corrected. Thus does the ego damn and
reason save.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup> Reason is not salvation in itself, but it makes way for peace and
brings you to a state of mind in which salvation can be given you. Sin
is a block, set like a heavy gate, locked and without a key, across the
road to peace. No one who looks on it without the help of reason would
try to pass it. The body’s eyes behold it as solid granite, so thick it
would be madness to attempt to pass it. Yet reason sees through it
easily <em>because</em> it is an error. The form it takes cannot conceal its
emptiness from reason’s eyes.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup> <em>Only</em> the form of error attracts the ego. Meaning it does not
recognize and does not know if it is there or not. Everything which the
body’s eyes can see is a mistake, an error in perception, a distorted
fragment of the whole, without the meaning that the whole would give.
And yet mistakes, regardless of their form, can be corrected. Sin is but
error in a special form the ego venerates. It would preserve all errors
and make them sins. For here is its own stability, its heavy anchor in
the shifting world it made—the rock on which its church is built and
where its worshipers are bound to bodies and believe the body’s freedom
is their own.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup> Reason will tell you that the form of error is not what makes it a
mistake. If what the form <em>conceals</em> is a mistake, the form cannot
prevent correction. The body’s eyes see <em>only</em> form. They cannot see
beyond what they were <em>made</em> to see. And they were made to look on error
and not see past it. Theirs is indeed a strange perception, for they can
see only illusions, unable to look beyond the granite block of sin and
stopping at the outside form of nothing. To this distorted form of
vision, the outside of everything, the wall that stands between you and
the truth, is wholly true. Yet how can sight which stops at nothingness
as if it were a solid wall see truly? It is held back by form, having
been made to guarantee that nothing else but form will be perceived.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup> These eyes, made <em>not</em> to see, will <em>never</em> see. For the idea they
represent left not its maker, and it is their maker that sees through
them. What was its maker’s <em>goal</em> but not to see? For this the body’s
eyes are perfect means, but not for <em>seeing</em>. See how the body’s eyes
rest on externals and cannot go beyond. Watch how they stop at
nothingness, unable to go beyond the form to meaning. Nothing so
blinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding
has been obscured.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup> Only <em>mistakes</em> have different forms, and so they can deceive. You
can change form <em>because</em> it is not true. It could not be reality,
<em>because</em> it can be changed. Reason will tell you that, if form is not
reality, it must be an illusion and is not <em>there</em> to see. And if you
see it, you must be mistaken, for you are seeing what can <em>not</em> be real
as if it <em>were</em>. What cannot see beyond what is not there <em>must</em> be
distorted perception and must perceive illusions as the truth. Could it
then <em>recognize</em> the truth?</p>

<p><sup>36</sup> Let not the <em>form</em> of his mistakes keep you from him whose holiness
is yours. Let not the vision of his holiness, the sight of which would
show you your forgiveness, be kept from you by what the body’s eyes can
see. Let your awareness of your brother not be blocked by your
perception of his sins and of his body. What is there in him that you
would attack except what you associate with his body, which <em>you</em>
believe can sin? Beyond his errors is <em>his</em> holiness and <em>your</em>
salvation. You gave him not his holiness but tried to see your sins in
him to save yourself. And yet his holiness <em>is</em> your forgiveness. Can
<em>you</em> be saved by making sinful the one whose holiness is your
salvation?</p>

<p><sup>37</sup> A holy relationship, however newly born, must value holiness above
all else. Unholy values will produce confusion, and in <em>awareness</em>. In
an unholy relationship, each one is valued because he seems to justify
the other’s sin. He sees within the other what impels him to sin against
his will. And thus he lays his sins upon the other and is attracted to
him to <em>perpetuate</em> his sins. And so it must become impossible for each
to see himself as <em>causing</em> sin by his desire to have sin real. Yet
reason sees a holy relationship as what it is—a common state of mind,
where both give errors gladly to correction that both may happily be
healed as one.</p>
