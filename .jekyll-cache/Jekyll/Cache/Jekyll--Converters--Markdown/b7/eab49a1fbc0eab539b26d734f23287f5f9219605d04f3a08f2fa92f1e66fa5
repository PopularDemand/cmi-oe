I"í<p class="lesson-header">I have no cause for anger or for fear,<br />
For You surround me. And in every need<br />
That I perceive, Your grace suffices me.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, let me remember You are here, and I am not alone.
Surrounding me is everlasting Love. I have no cause for anything except
the perfect peace and joy I share with You. What need have I for anger
or for fear? Surrounding me is perfect safety. Can I be afraid when Your
eternal promise goes with me? Surrounding me is perfect sinlessness.
What can I fear when You created me in holiness as perfect as Your own.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Godâ€™s grace suffices us in everything that He would have us
do. And only that we choose to be our will, as well as His.</p>
