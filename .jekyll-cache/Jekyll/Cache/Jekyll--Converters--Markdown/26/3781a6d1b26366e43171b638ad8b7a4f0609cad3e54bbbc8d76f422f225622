I"—<p class="lesson-header">Forgiveness is the only gift I give.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Forgiveness is the only gift I give because it is the only
gift I want, and everything I give I give myself. This is salvationâ€™s
simple formula. And I, who would be saved, would make it mine to be the
way I live within a world that needs salvation and that will be saved as
I accept Atonement for myself.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, how certain are Your ways, how sure their final
outcome, and how truly faithful is every step in my salvation set
already and accomplished by Your grace. Thanks be to You for Your
eternal gifts, and thanks to You for my Identity.</em></p>
