I"º!<p><sup>3</sup> The ego is an ally of time, but not a friend. For it is as mistrustful
of death as it is of life, and what it wants for you it cannot tolerate.
The ego wants <em>you</em> dead, but <em>not</em> itself. The outcome of its strange
religion must therefore be the conviction that it can pursue you beyond
the grave. And out of its unwillingness for you to find peace even in
the death it wants for you, it offers you immortality in hell. It speaks
to you of Heaven but assures you that Heaven is not for you. How can the
guilty hope for Heaven? The belief in hell is inescapable to those who
identify with the ego. Their nightmares and their fears are all
associated with it.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> The ego teaches that hell is in the <em>future</em>, for this is what all its
teaching is directed to. Hell is its <em>goal</em>, for although the ego aims
at death and dissolution as an end, it does not <em>believe</em> it. The goal
of death, which it craves for you, leaves it unsatisfied. No one who
follows the ego‚Äôs teaching is without the fear of death. Yet if death
were thought of merely as an end to pain, would it be <em>feared</em>? We have
seen this strange paradox in the ego‚Äôs thought system before, but never
so clearly as here. For the ego must seem to <em>keep</em> fear from you to
keep your allegiance. Yet it must <em>engender</em> fear in order to maintain
<em>itself</em>.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Again the ego tries and all too frequently succeeds in doing both by
using dissociation for holding its contradictory aims together so that
they <em>seem</em> to be reconciled. The ego teaches thus: Death is the end as
far as hope of Heaven goes. Yet because you and itself cannot be
separated, and because it cannot conceive of its <em>own</em> death, it will
pursue you still because guilt is eternal. Such is the ego‚Äôs version of
immortality. And it is this the ego‚Äôs version of time supports.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> The ego teaches that Heaven is here and now because the <em>future</em> is
hell. Even when it attacks so savagely that it tries to take the life of
someone who hears it temporarily as the <em>only</em> voice, it speaks of hell
even to him. For it tells him hell is <em>here</em> and bids him leap from hell
into oblivion. The only time the ego allows anyone to look upon with
some amount of equanimity is the past. And even there its only value is
that it is no more.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> How bleak and despairing is the ego‚Äôs use of time! And how terrifying!
For underneath its fanatical insistence that the past and future be the
same is hidden a far more insidious threat to peace. The ego does not
advertise its final threat, for it would have its worshipers still
believe that it can offer the <em>escape</em> from it. But the belief in guilt
<em>must</em> lead to the belief in hell, <em>and</em> <em>always does</em>. The only way in
which the ego allows the fear of hell to be experienced is to bring hell
<em>here</em>, but always as a foretaste of the future. For no one who
considers himself as deserving hell can believe that punishment will end
in peace.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> The Holy Spirit teaches thus: There <em>is</em> no hell. Hell is only what
the ego has made of the <em>present.</em> The belief in hell is what prevents
you from <em>understanding</em> the present, because you are <em>afraid</em> of it.
The Holy Spirit leads as steadily to Heaven as the ego drives to hell.
For the Holy Spirit, Who knows <em>only</em> the present, uses it to undo the
fear by which the ego would make the present useless. There is <em>no</em>
escape from fear in the ego‚Äôs use of time. For time, according to its
teaching, is nothing but a teaching device for <em>compounding</em> guilt until
it becomes all-encompassing and demands vengeance forever.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> The Holy Spirit would undo all of this <em>now</em>. Fear is <em>not</em> of the
present but only of the past and future, which do not exist. There is no
fear in the present when each instant stands clear and separated from
the past, without its shadow reaching out into the future. Each instant
is a clean, untarnished birth, in which the Son of God emerges from the
past into the present. And the present extends forever. It is so
beautiful and so clean and free of guilt that nothing but happiness is
there. No darkness is remembered, and immortality and joy are <em>now</em>.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> This lesson takes <em>no</em> time. For what is time without a past and
future? It <em>has</em> taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes
no time at all to be what you <em>are.</em> Begin to practice the Holy Spirit‚Äôs
use of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace. Take this very
instant, <em>now</em>, and think of it as <em>all there is</em> of time. Nothing can
reach you here out of the past, and it is here that you are <em>completely</em>
absolved, <em>completely</em> free, and <em>wholly</em> without condemnation. From
this holy instant wherein holiness was born again, you will go forth in
time without fear and with no sense of change <em>with</em> time.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Time is inconceivable without change, yet holiness does not change.
Learn from this instant more than merely hell does not exist. In this
redeeming instant lies Heaven. And Heaven will not change, for the birth
into the holy present is <em>salvation</em> from change. Change is an illusion,
taught by those who could not see themselves as guiltless. There is no
change in Heaven because there is no change in God. In the holy instant
in which you see yourself as bright with freedom, you <em>will</em> remember
God. For remembering Him <em>is</em> to remember freedom.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> Whenever you are tempted to be dispirited by the thought of how long
it would take to change your mind so completely, ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow long
is an instant?‚Äù Could you not give so short a time to the Holy Spirit
for your salvation? He asks no more, for He has no need of more. It
takes far longer to teach you how to be willing to give Him this than
for Him to use this tiny instant to offer you the whole of Heaven. In
exchange for this instant, He stands ready to give you the remembrance
of eternity.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> You will never give this holy instant to the Holy Spirit on behalf of
your release while you are unwilling to give it to your brothers on
behalf of <em>theirs.</em> For the instant of holiness is shared, and cannot be
yours alone. Remember, then, when you are tempted to attack a brother,
that his instant of release is <em>yours</em>. Miracles are the instants of
release you offer and will <em>receive</em>. They attest to your willingness to
<em>be</em> released and to offer time to the Holy Spirit for His use of it.
How long is an instant? It is as short for your brother as it is for
you. Practice giving this blessed instant of freedom to all who are
enslaved by time and thus make time their friend <em>for</em> them. The Holy
Spirit gives their blessed instant to <em>you</em> through your giving it. As
you give it, He offers it to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> Be not unwilling to give what you would receive of Him, for you join
with Him in giving. In the crystal cleanness of the release you give is
your <em>instantaneous</em> escape from guilt. You <em>must</em> be holy if you offer
holiness. How long is an instant? As long as it takes to reestablish
perfect sanity, perfect peace, and perfect love for everyone, for God,
and for <em>yourself</em>. As long as it takes to remember immortality and your
immortal creations who share it with you. As long as it takes to
exchange hell for Heaven. Long enough to transcend all of the ego‚Äôs
making and ascend unto your Father.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> Time is your friend if you leave it to the Holy Spirit to use. He
needs but very little to restore God‚Äôs whole power to you. He Who
transcends time for you understands what time is <em>for</em>. Holiness lies
not in time but in eternity. There never was an instant in which God‚Äôs
Son could lose his purity. His changeless state is beyond time, for his
purity remains forever beyond attack and without variability. Time
stands still in his holiness and changes not. And so it is no longer
time at all. For, caught in the single instant of the eternal sanctity
of God‚Äôs creation, it is transformed into forever. <em>Give</em> the eternal
instant that eternity may be remembered <em>for</em> you in that shining
instant of perfect release. Offer the miracle of the holy instant
through the Holy Spirit and leave His giving it to you to Him.</p>
