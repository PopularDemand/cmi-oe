I"ø<p class="lesson-header">This day is Godâ€™s. It is my gift to Him.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I will not lead my life alone today. I do not understand
the world. And so to try to lead my life alone must be but foolishness.
For there is One Who knows all that is best for me. And He is glad to
make no choices for me but the ones that lead to God. This day I give to
Him, for I would not delay my coming home, and it is He Who knows the
way to Him.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>And so we give today to You. We come with wholly open
minds. We do not ask for anything that we may think we want. Give us
what You would have received by us. You know all our desires and our
needs. And You will give us everything we want and that will help us
find the way to You</em>.</p>
