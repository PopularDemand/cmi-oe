I"ò<p class="lesson-header">I am under no laws but God‚Äôs.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> We have observed before how many senseless things have
seemed to you to be salvation. Each has imprisoned you with laws as
senseless as itself. You are not bound by them. Yet to understand that
this is so, you must first realize salvation lies not there. While you
would seek for it in things that have no meaning, you bind yourself to
laws that make no sense. Thus do you seek to prove salvation is where it
is not.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Today we will be glad you cannot prove it. For if you
could, you would forever seek where it is not and never find it. The
idea for today tells you once again how simple is salvation. Look for it
where it waits for you, and there it will be found. Look nowhere else,
for it is nowhere else.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Think of the freedom in the recognition that you are not
bound by all the strange and twisted laws which you have set up to save
you. You really think that you would starve unless you have stacks of
green paper strips and piles of metal discs. You really think a small
round pellet or some fluid pushed into your veins through a sharpened
needle will ward off death. You really think you are alone unless
another body is with you.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> It is insanity that thinks these things. You call them laws
and put them under different names in a long catalogue of rituals that
have no use and serve no purpose. You think you must obey the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù of
medicine, of economics, and of health. Protect the body, and you will be
saved.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> These are not laws, but madness. The body is endangered by
the mind that hurts itself. The body suffers that the mind will fail to
see it is the victim of itself. The body‚Äôs suffering is a mask the mind
holds up to hide what really suffers. It would not understand it is its
own enemy, that it attacks itself and wants to die. It is from this your
‚Äúlaws‚Äù would save the body. It is for this you think you are a body.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> There are no laws except the laws of God. This needs
repeating over and over until you realize that it applies to everything
that you have made in opposition to His Will. Your magic has no meaning.
What it is meant to save does not exist. Only what it is meant to hide
will save you.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> The laws of God can never be replaced. We will devote today
to rejoicing that this is so. It is no longer a truth which we would
hide. We realize instead it is a truth which keeps us free forever.
Magic imprisons, but the laws of God set free. The light has come
because there are no laws but His.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> We will begin the longer practice period today with a short
review of the different kinds of ‚Äúlaws‚Äù we have believed we must obey.
These would include, for example, the laws of nutrition, of
immunization, of medication, and of the body‚Äôs protection in innumerable
ways. Think further‚Äîyou believe in the laws of friendship, of ‚Äúgood‚Äù
relationships, and reciprocity.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> Perhaps you even think that there are laws which set forth
what is God‚Äôs and what is yours. Many ‚Äúreligions‚Äù have been based on
this. They would not save, but damn in Heaven‚Äôs name. Yet they are no
more strange than other ‚Äúlaws‚Äù you hold must be obeyed to make you safe.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> There are no laws but God‚Äôs. Dismiss all foolish magical
beliefs today and hold your mind in silent readiness to hear the Voice
that speaks the truth to you. You will be listening to One Who says
there is no loss under the laws of God. Payment is neither given nor
received. Exchange cannot be made, there are no substitutes, and nothing
is replaced by something else. God‚Äôs laws forever give and never take.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Hear Him Who tells you this, and realize how foolish are
the laws you thought upheld the world you thought you saw. Then listen
further. He will tell you more. About the love your Father has for you.
About the endless joy He offers you. About His yearning for His only
Son, created as His channel for creation, denied to Him by his belief in
hell.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> Let us today open God‚Äôs channels to Him and let His Will
extend through us to Him. Thus is creation endlessly increased. His
Voice will speak of this to us, as well as of the joys of Heaven which
His laws keep limitless forever. We will repeat today‚Äôs idea until we
have listened and understood there are no laws but God‚Äôs. Then we will
tell ourselves as a dedication with which the practice period concludes:</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> <em>I am under no laws but God‚Äôs.</em></p>

<p><sup>14</sup> We will repeat this dedication as often as possible
today‚Äîat least four or five times an hour, as well as in response to any
temptation to experience ourselves as subject to other laws throughout
the day. It is our statement of freedom from all danger and all tyranny.
It is our acknowledgment that God is our Father and that His Son is
saved.</p>
