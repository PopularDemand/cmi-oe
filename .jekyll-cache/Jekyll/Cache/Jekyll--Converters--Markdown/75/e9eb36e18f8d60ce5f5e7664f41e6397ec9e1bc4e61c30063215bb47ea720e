<p><sup>1</sup> The idea for today can be regarded as the central thought
toward which all our exercises are directed. Godâ€™s is the only will.
When you have recognized this, you have recognized that your will is
His. The belief that conflict is possible has gone. Peace has replaced
the strange idea that you are torn by conflicting goals. As an
expression of the Will of God, you have no goal but His.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> There is great peace in todayâ€™s idea. And the exercises for
today are directed towards finding it. The idea itself is wholly true.
Therefore it cannot give rise to illusions. Without illusions, conflict
is impossible. Let us try to recognize this today and experience the
peace this recognition brings.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Begin the longer practice periods by repeating these
thoughts several times, slowly and with firm determination to understand
what they mean and to hold them in mind:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>There is no will but Godâ€™s.<br />
I cannot be in conflict.</em></p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Then spend several minutes in adding some related thoughts,
such as:</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> <em>I am at peace.<br />
Nothing can disturb me. My will is Godâ€™s.<br />
My will and Godâ€™s are one.<br />
God wills peace for His Son.</em></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> During this introductory phase, be sure to deal quickly
with any conflict thoughts that may cross your mind. Tell yourself
immediately:</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> <em>There is no will but Godâ€™s.<br />
These conflict thoughts are meaningless.</em></p>

<p><sup>9</sup> If there is one conflict area which seems particularly
difficult to resolve, single it out for special consideration. Think
about it briefly but very specifically, identify the particular person
or persons and the situation or situations involved, and tell yourself:</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> <em>There is no will but Godâ€™s.<br />
I share it with Him.<br />
My conflicts about _____ cannot be real.</em> Â </p>

<p><sup>11</sup> After you have cleared your mind in this way, close your
eyes and try to experience the peace to which your reality entitles you.
Sink into it, and feel it closing around you. There may be some
temptation to mistake these attempts for withdrawal, but the difference
is easily detected. If you are succeeding, you will feel a deep sense of
joy and an increased alertness rather than a feeling of drowsiness and
enervation. Joy characterizes peace. By this experience will you
recognize that you have reached it.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> If you feel yourself slipping off into withdrawal, quickly
repeat the idea for today and try again. Do this as often as necessary.
There is definite gain in refusing to allow retreat into withdrawal,
even if you do not experience the peace you seek.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> In the shorter periods, which should be undertaken at
regular and predetermined intervals today, say to yourself:</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> <em>There is no will but Godâ€™s.<br />
I seek His peace today.</em></p>

<p><sup>15</sup> Then try to find what you are seeking. A minute or two
every half-hour, with eyes closed if possible, would be well spent on
this today.</p>
