<p><sup>1</sup> Today we will continue with the theme of happiness. This is
a key idea in understanding what salvation means. You still believe it
asks for suffering as penance for your ‚Äúsins.‚Äù This is not so. Yet you
must think it so while you believe that sin is real and that God‚Äôs Son
can sin. If sin is real, then punishment is just and cannot be escaped.
Salvation thus cannot be purchased but through suffering.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> If sin is real then happiness must be illusion, for they
cannot both be true. The sinful warrant only death and pain, and it is
this they ask for, for they know it waits for them and it will seek them
out and find them somewhere, sometime, in some form which evens the
account they owe to God. They would escape Him in their fear. And yet He
will pursue, and they cannot escape.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> If sin is real, salvation must be pain. Pain is the cost of
sin, and suffering can never be escaped if sin is real. Salvation must
be feared, for it will kill but slowly, taking everything away before it
grants the welcome boon of death to victims who are little more than
bones before salvation is appeased. Its wrath is boundless, merciless,
but wholly just.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Who would seek out such savage punishment? Who would not
flee salvation and attempt in every way he can to drown the Voice Which
offers it to him? Why would he try to listen and accept Its offering? If
sin is real, its offering is death and meted out in cruel form to match
the vicious wishes in which sin is born. If sin is real, salvation has
become your bitter enemy, the curse of God upon you who have crucified
His Son.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> You need the practice periods today. The exercises teach
sin is not real, and all that you believe must come from sin will never
happen, for it has no cause. Accept Atonement with an open mind which
cherishes no lingering belief that you have made a devil of God‚Äôs Son.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> There is no sin. We practice with this thought as often as
we can today because it is the basis for today‚Äôs idea. God‚Äôs Will for
you is perfect happiness because there is no sin, and suffering is
causeless. Joy is just, and pain is but the sign you have misunderstood
yourself.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Fear not the Will of God. But turn to it in confidence that
it will set you free from all the consequences sin has wrought in
feverish imagination. Say:</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> <em>God‚Äôs Will for me is perfect happiness.<br />
There is no sin; it has no consequence.</em> ¬†</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> So should you start your practice periods, and then attempt
again to find the joy these thoughts will introduce into your mind. Give
these five minutes gladly to remove the heavy load you laid upon
yourself with the insane belief that sin is real.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Today escape from madness. You are set on freedom‚Äôs road,
and now today‚Äôs idea brings wings to speed you on and hope to go still
faster to the waiting goal of peace. There is no sin. Remember this
today, and tell yourself as often as you can:</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> <em>God‚Äôs Will for me is perfect happiness.<br />
This is the truth because there is no sin.</em></p>
