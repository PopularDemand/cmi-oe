<p><sup>1</sup> It is quite possible to listen to Godâ€™s Voice all through the day
without interrupting your regular activities in any way. The part of
your mind in which truth abides is in constant communication with God,
whether you are aware of it or not. It is the other part of your mind
that functions in the world and obeys the worldâ€™s laws. It is this part
which is constantly distracted, disorganized, and highly uncertain.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The part that is listening to the Voice of God is calm, always at
rest, and wholly certain. It is really the only part there is. The other
part is a wild illusion, frantic and distraught, but without reality of
any kind. Try today not to listen to it. Try to identify with the part
of your mind where stillness and peace reign forever. Try to hear Godâ€™s
Voice call to you lovingly, reminding you that your Creator has not
forgotten His Son.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> We will need at least four five-minute practice periods today and more
if possible. We will try actually to hear the Voice reminding you of God
and of your Self. We will approach this happiest and holiest of thoughts
with confidence, knowing that in doing so we are joining our will with
the Will of God. He wants you to hear His Voice. He gave It to you to be
heard.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Listen in deep silence. Be very still, and open your mind. Go past all
the raucous shrieks and sick imaginings that cover your real thoughts
and obscure your eternal link with God. Sink deep into the peace that
waits for you beyond the frantic, riotous thoughts and sounds and sights
of this insane world. You do not live there. We are trying to reach your
real home. We are trying to reach the place where you are truly welcome.
We are trying to reach God.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Do not forget to repeat todayâ€™s idea very frequently. Do so with your
eyes open when necessary, but closed when possible. And be sure that you
sit quietly and repeat the idea for today slowly whenever you can,
closing your eyes on the world and realizing that you are inviting Godâ€™s
Voice to speak to you.</p>
