I"Â<p class="lesson-header">My Father gives all power unto me.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> The Son of God is limitless. There are no limits on his
strength, his peace, his joy, or any attributes his Father gave in his
creation. What he wills with his Creator and Redeemer must be done. His
holy will can never be denied because his Father shines upon his mind
and lays before it all the strength and love in earth and Heaven. I am
he to whom all this is given. I am he in whom the power of my Fatherâ€™s
Will abides.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Your Will can do all things in me and then extend to all
the world as well through me. There is no limit on Your Will. And so all
power has been given to Your Son.</em></p>
