I"˘<p><sup>38</sup> Idols are quite specific. But your will is universal, being
limitless. And so it has no form nor is content for its expression in
the terms of form. Idols are limits. They are the belief that there are
forms which will bring happiness and that, <em>by</em> limiting, is all
attained. It is as if you said, ‚ÄúI have no need of everything. This
little thing I want, and it will be as everything to me.‚Äù And this must
fail to satisfy because it is your will that everything be yours. Decide
for idols, and you <em>ask</em> for loss. Decide for truth, and everything <em>is</em>
yours.</p>

<p><sup>39</sup> It is not form you seek. What form can be a substitute for God the
Father‚Äôs love? What form can take the place of all the love in the
divinity of God the Son? What idol can make two of what is one? And
<em>can</em> the limitless be limited? You do not <em>want</em> an idol. It is not
your will to have one. It will not bestow on you the gift you seek. When
you decide upon the form of what you want, you lose the understanding of
its purpose. So you see your will within the idol, thus reducing it to a
specific form. Yet this could never <em>be</em> your will because what shares
in all creation cannot be content with small ideas and little things.</p>

<p><sup>40</sup> Behind the search for every idol lies the yearning for completion.
Wholeness has no form because it is unlimited. To seek a special person
or a thing to add to you to make yourself complete can only mean that
you believe some form is missing. And by finding this, you will achieve
completion in a form you like. This is the <em>purpose</em> of an idol‚Äîthat you
will not look beyond it to the source of the belief that you <em>are</em>
incomplete. <em>Only</em> if you had sinned could this be so. For sin is the
idea you are alone and separated off from what is whole. And thus it
would be necessary for the search for wholeness to be made <em>beyond</em> the
boundaries of limits on yourself.</p>

<p><sup>41</sup> It never is the <em>idol</em> that you want. But what you think it offers
you, you want indeed and have the <em>right</em> to ask for. Nor could it be
possible it be denied. Your will to be complete is but God‚Äôs Will, and
this is <em>given</em> you by being His. God knows not form. He cannot answer
you in terms which have no meaning. And your will could not be satisfied
with empty forms made but to fill a gap which is not there. It is not
this you <em>want.</em> Creation gives no separate person and no separate thing
the power to complete the Son of God. What idol can be called upon to
give the Son of God what he already has?</p>

<p><sup>42</sup> Completion is the <em>function</em> of God‚Äôs Son. He has no need to seek for
it at all. Beyond all idols stands his holy will to be but what he is.
For more than whole is meaningless. If there were change in him, if he
could be reduced to any form and limited to what is not in him, he would
not be as God created him. What idol can he need to be himself? For can
he give a part of him away? What is not whole cannot make whole. But
what is really asked for cannot <em>be</em> denied. Your will <em>is</em> granted. Not
in any form that would content you not, but in the whole completely
lovely Thought God holds of you.</p>

<p><sup>43</sup> Nothing that God knows not exists. And what He knows exists forever,
changelessly. For thoughts endure as long as does the mind that thought
of them. And in the Mind of God there is no ending nor a time in which
His Thoughts were absent or could suffer change. Thoughts are not born
and cannot die. They share the attributes of their creator, nor have
they a separate life apart from his. The thoughts you think are in your
mind, as you are in the mind Which thought of you. And so there are no
separate parts in what exists within God‚Äôs Mind. It is forever one,
eternally united and at peace.</p>

<p><sup>44</sup> Thoughts seem to come and go. Yet all this means is that you are
sometimes aware of them and sometimes not. An unremembered thought is
born again to you when it returns to your awareness. Yet it did not die
when you forgot it. It was always there, but you were unaware of it. The
Thought God holds of you is perfectly unchanged by your forgetting. It
will always be exactly as it was before the time when you forgot and
will be just the same when you remember. And it is the same within the
interval when you forgot.</p>

<p><sup>45</sup> The Thoughts of God are far beyond all change and shine forever. They
await not birth. They wait for welcome and remembering. The Thought God
holds of you is like a star, unchangeable in an eternal sky. So high in
Heaven is it set that those outside of Heaven know not it is there. Yet
still and white and lovely will it shine through all eternity. There was
no time it was not there; no instant when its light grew dimmer or less
perfect ever was.</p>

<p><sup>46</sup> Who knows the Father knows this light, for He is the eternal sky
which holds it safe, forever lifted up, and anchored sure. Its perfect
purity does not depend on whether it is seen on earth or not. The sky
embraces it and softly holds it in its perfect place, which is as far
from earth as earth from Heaven. It is not the distance nor the time
which keeps this star invisible to earth. But those who seek for idols
cannot know this star is there.</p>

<p><sup>47</sup> Beyond all idols is the Thought God holds of you. Completely
unaffected by the turmoil and the terror of the world, the dreams of
birth and death that here are dreamed, the myriad of forms that fear can
take; quite undisturbed, the Thought God holds of you remains exactly as
it always was. Surrounded by a stillness so complete no sound of battle
comes remotely near, it rests in certainty and perfect peace. Here is
your one reality kept safe, completely unaware of all the world that
worships idols and that knows not God. In perfect sureness of its
changelessness and of its rest in its eternal home, the Thought God
holds of you has never left the mind of its Creator Whom it knows, as
its Creator knows that it is there.</p>

<p><sup>48</sup> Where could the Thought God holds of you exist but where <em>you</em> are?
Is your reality a thing apart from you and in a world which your reality
knows nothing of? Outside you there is no eternal sky, no changeless
star, and no reality. The mind of Heaven‚Äôs Son in Heaven is, for there
the mind of Father and Son joined in creation which can have no end. You
have not two realities, but one. Nor can you be <em>aware</em> of more than
one. An idol <em>or</em> the Thought God holds of you is your reality. Forget
not, then, that idols must keep hidden what you are, not from the Mind
of God, but from your own. The star shines still; the sky has never
changed. But you, the holy Son of God Himself, are unaware of your
reality.</p>
