I"Õ<p><sup>1</sup> Today‚Äôs review covers these ideas:</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[6] I am upset because I see what is not there.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Reality is never frightening. It is impossible that it
could upset me.  Reality brings only perfect peace. When I am upset, it
is always because I have replaced reality with illusions which I made
up. The illusions are upsetting because I have given them reality and
thus regard reality as an illusion. Nothing in God‚Äôs creation is
affected in any way by this confusion of mine. I am always upset by
nothing.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[7] I see only the past.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> As I look about, I condemn the world I look upon. I call
this seeing.  I hold the past against everyone and everything, making
them my ‚Äúenemies.‚Äù When I have forgiven myself and remembered who I am,
I will bless everyone and everything I see. There will be no past and
therefore no ‚Äúenemies.‚Äù And I will look with love on all that I failed
to see before.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[8] My mind is preoccupied with past thoughts.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> I see only my own thoughts, and my mind is preoccupied with
the past.  What, then, can I see as it is? Let me remember that I look
on the past to prevent the present from dawning on my mind. Let me
understand that I am trying to use time against God. Let me learn to
give the past away, realizing that in so doing I am giving up nothing.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[9] I see nothing as it is now.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> If I see nothing as it is now, it can truly be said that I
see nothing. I can see only what is now. The choice is not whether to
see the past or the present: it is whether to see or not. What I have
chosen to see has cost me vision. Now I would choose again that I may
see.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[10] My thoughts do not mean anything.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> I have no private thoughts. Yet it is only private thoughts
of which I am aware. What can these thoughts mean? They do not exist,
and so they mean nothing. Yet my mind is part of creation and part of
its Creator.  Would I not rather join the thinking of the universe than
to obscure all that is really mine with my pitiful and meaningless
‚Äúprivate‚Äù thoughts?</p>
