I"¡<p class="lesson-header">Creationâ€™s freedom promises my own.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> The end of dreams is promised me because Godâ€™s Son is not
abandoned by His Love. Only in dreams is there a time when he appears to
be in prison and awaits a future freedom if it be at all. Yet in reality
his dreams are gone, with truth established in their place. And now is
freedom his already. Should I wait in chains which have been severed for
release, when God is offering me freedom now?</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>I will accept Your promises today and give my faith to
them. My Father loves the Son Whom He created as His own. Would You
withhold the gifts You gave to me?</em></p>
