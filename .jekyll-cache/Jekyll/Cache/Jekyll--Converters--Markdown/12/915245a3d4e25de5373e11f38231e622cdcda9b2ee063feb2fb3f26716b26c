I"}<p class="lesson-header">Today the peace of God envelops me,<br />
And I forget all things except His Love.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, I wake today with miracles correcting my
perception of all things. And so begins the day I share with You as I
will share eternity, for time has stepped aside today. I do not seek the
things of time, and so I will not look upon them. What I seek today
transcends all laws of time and things perceived in time. I would forget
all things except Your Love. I would abide in You and know no laws
except Your law of Love. And I would find the peace which You created
for Your Son, forgetting all the foolish toys I made as I behold Your
glory and my own.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> And when the evening comes today, we will remember nothing
but the peace of God. For we will learn today what peace is ours when we
forget all things except God’s Love.</p>
