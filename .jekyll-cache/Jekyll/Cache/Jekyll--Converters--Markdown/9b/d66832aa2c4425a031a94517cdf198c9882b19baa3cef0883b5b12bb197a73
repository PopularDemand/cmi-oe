I"W<p class="lesson-header">Today I claim the gifts forgiveness gives.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I will not wait another day to find the treasures which my
Father offers me. Illusions must be vain and dreams are gone, even while
they are woven out of thoughts that rest on false perception. Let me not
accept such meager gifts again today. God’s Voice is offering the peace
of God to all who hear and choose to follow Him. This is my choice
today. And so I go to find the treasures God has given me.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>I seek but the eternal. For Your Son can be content with
nothing less than this. What then can be his solace but what You are
offering to his bewildered mind and frightened heart, to give him
certainty and bring him peace? Today I would behold my brother sinless.
This Your Will for me, for thus will I behold my sinlessness.</em></p>
