I"Ç<p class="lesson-header">Let me remember that my goal is God.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> All that is needful is to train our minds to overlook all
little, senseless aims and to remember that our goal is God. His memory
is hidden in our minds, obscured but by our pointless little goals which
offer nothing and do not exist. Shall we continue to allow Godâ€™s grace
to shine in unawareness while the toys and trinkets of the world are
sought instead? God is our only goal, our only Love. We have no aim but
to remember Him.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Our goal is but to follow in the way that leads to You. We
have no goal but this. What could we want but to remember You? What
could we seek but our Identity?</em></p>
