<p><sup>1</sup> <em>How foolish, Father, to believe Your Son could cause
himself to suffer! Could he make a plan for his damnation and be left
without a certain way to his release? You love me, Father. You could
never leave me desolate, to die within a world of pain and cruelty. How
could I think that Love has left Itself? There is no will except the
will of Love. Fear is a dream and has no will that can conflict with
Yours. Conflict is sleep, and peace awakening. Death is illusion; life,
Eternal Truth. There is no opposition to Your Will. There is no
conflict, for my will is Yours.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Forgiveness shows us that God’s Will is one and that we
share it. Let us look upon the holy sights forgiveness shows today that
we may find the peace of God. Amen.</p>
