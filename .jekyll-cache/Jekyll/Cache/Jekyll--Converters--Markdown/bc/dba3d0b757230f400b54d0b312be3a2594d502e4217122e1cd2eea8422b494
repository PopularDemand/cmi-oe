<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, Christâ€™s vision is Your gift to me, and it has
power to translate all that the bodyâ€™s eyes behold into the sight of a
forgiven world. How glorious and gracious is this world! Yet how much
more will I perceive in it than sight can give. The world forgiven
signifies Your Son acknowledges his Father, lets his dreams be brought
to truth, and waits expectantly the one remaining instant more of time,
which ends forever as Your memory returns to him. And now his will is
one with Yours. His function now is but Your own, and every thought
except Your own is gone.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The quiet of today will bless our hearts, and through them
peace will come to everyone. Christ is our eyes today. And through His
sight, we offer healing to the world through Him, the holy Son whom God
created whole, the holy Son whom God created one.</p>
