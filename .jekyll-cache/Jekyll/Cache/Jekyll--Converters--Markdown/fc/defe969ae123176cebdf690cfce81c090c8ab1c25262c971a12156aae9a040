I"o<p class="lesson-header">Father, my freedom is in You alone.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>I did not understand what made me free nor what my freedom
is nor where to look to find it. Father, I have searched in vain until I
heard Your Voice directing me. Now I would guide myself no more. For I
have neither made nor understood the way to find my freedom. But I trust
in You. You Who endowed me with my freedom as Your holy Son will not be
lost to me. Your Voice directs me. And the way to You is opening and
clear to me at last. Father, my freedom is in You alone. Father, it is
my will that I return.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Today we answer for the world, which will be freed along
with us. How glad are we to find our freedom through the certain way our
Father has established. And how sure is all the world’s salvation when
we learn our freedom can be found in God alone.</p>
